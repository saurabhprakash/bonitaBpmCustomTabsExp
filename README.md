# bonitaBpmCustomTabsExp


Workflow example which supports following things with bonita UI forms:
 - Custom tabs(Using default buttons) structure with re-ordering support
 - Validation at container level(partial forms validation were not supported)
 
So this experiment has 3 tabs, All tabs with some data, 2nd tabs has one radio list, current validation is that it shows 3rd tab only when 2nd tab radio button is selected, else it shows an error message(when clicked on next button).
